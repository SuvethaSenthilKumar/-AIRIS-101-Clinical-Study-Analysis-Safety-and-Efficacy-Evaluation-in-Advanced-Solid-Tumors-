# Clinical Trial Safety and Efficacy Analysis in R  

## ðŸ“„ Abstract  
This project demonstrates the application of **statistical programming in R** to analyze clinical trial datasets (SDTM/ADaM). The analysis explores **adverse events (AEs), exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIR), survival outcomes, laboratory/vital sign changes, concomitant medication use, and baseline medical history** across treatment arms.  

Findings suggest **no major safety imbalances**, but trends in **AE timing and rescue medication usage** highlight areas for further monitoring. The project serves as a reproducible framework for clinical data analysis in drug development.

## ðŸ”¬ Methods  

### Data Sources  
- Derived from **clinical trial ADaM/SDTM datasets**  
- Key domains analyzed: **AE, DM, EX, LB, VS, CM, MH**  

### Statistical Analysis  
- **Adverse Events (AEs):** Incidence compared across arms (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, multiplicity adjustment)  
- **Exposure Adjustment:** EAIR = (Number of AEs Ã· Total exposure days) Ã— 365  
- **Time-to-Event:** Kaplanâ€“Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models  
- **Laboratory & Vital Signs:** Change from baseline (ANOVA/repeated measures); Grade â‰¥3 toxicities flagged  
- **Concomitant Medications (CM):** Usage summarized; class-level heatmaps plotted  
- **Medical History (MH):** Baseline balance across treatment arms  

### Software  
- **R** (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, survival, broom)  
- Visualizations created with **ggplot2** and survival analysis functions

## ðŸ“Š Results  

### 1. Adverse Events (AEs)  
- Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs comparable across arms  
- After multiplicity adjustment, **no AE reached statistical significance**

### 2. Exposure-Adjusted Incidence Rate (EAIR)  
- EAIR revealed **one arm with disproportionately higher AE burden relative to exposure**

---

### 3. Time-to-First AE (Survival Analysis)  
- Kaplanâ€“Meier curves showed **earlier AE onset in one arm**  
- Cox model HR suggested increased AE risk, though not statistically significant

### 4. Laboratory & Vital Signs  
- A few **Grade 3+ abnormalities** observed, but not clustered in a single arm  
- Vital signs showed **no clinically significant shifts**  


---

### 5. Concomitant Medications (CM)  
- CM use consistent across arms  
- Slightly higher **rescue medication use** in one arm

### 6. Medical History (MH)  
- Balanced distribution of baseline medical history across arms  
- Confirms **successful randomization**

## ðŸ§¾ Discussion  
- **Multiplicity adjustment** reduced apparent AE differences â†’ avoids false positives  
- **Exposure-adjusted metrics** uncovered hidden differences not visible from raw counts  
- **Survival analysis** suggested earlier AE onset in one arm, though inconclusive  
- **Lab/vital signs stable**, supporting safety  
- **Rescue medication trends** may warrant further monitoring

## âœ… Conclusion  
- No major safety imbalances across arms  
- Exposure adjustment is critical for fair AE comparison  
- Trends in AE timing & rescue medication use highlight tolerability signals  
- Framework offers a **reproducible R-based pipeline** for clinical trial safety analysis  

## Future Work  
-Planned to work on with the SDTM,ADAM,TLF analysis with the current dataset as an extensive analysis
- Extend analysis to **PK/PD datasets** to explore exposureâ€“response relationships  
- Apply **Bayesian hierarchical models** for robust inference in small sample sizes  
- Develop an **interactive Shiny dashboard** for clinical trial monitoring  
- Automate **data pipelines** for multi-study integration
